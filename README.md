# ubuntu_kernel_cleanup

Basically, just some utilities to cleanup old kernels in Ubuntu.

As of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS there was no good, publically available way to remove old kernels, so I wrote one that works on 18.04 LTS and newer. It's also fully tested and working on 20.04 LTS. What's here will also handle kernel removal in older versions of Ubuntu as well using the older byobu method.
